# This buildpack.yml file tells the Cloud Native Buildpacks toolchain how to build a container image for an Angular app.

# The buildpacks field specifies which buildpacks to use and their order.
# In this example, we use the official Node.js buildpack to install Node.js and npm,
# followed by the official Angular buildpack to build the Angular app.
buildpacks:
  - nodejs
  - gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/angular

# The env field specifies any environment variables that should be set in the container at runtime.
# In this example, we set the NODE_ENV variable to "production" to optimize the app for production.
env:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  PORT: 8080
